			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>By day I am an IT professional with 25+ years of experience.  
			Currently, I am a Mobile QA analyst at Bloomberg.    
			I support about 10 developers on both iOS and Android platforms.  
			I also interact with global testers via Applause to help aid our testing efforts.  
			I really enjoy the mobile environment and I look forward to my job every day.  
			Not many people say that as often as I do!  Currently, I am becoming more familiar with programming languages, 
			such as ruby, with the goal of developing automation testing skills.  
			I have also been attending meetups and taking classes on lynda.com  My boss is a great mentor and coach in this regard.</p>
			<p>By night, I am a creative person.  I have been an avid photographer for over 15 years.  
			I enjoy photographing mostly landscapes, abstracts, macro and unusual happenstance.  
			My favorite subjects to photograph are abandoned places.  Photography is my way of combining technology and creativity.  
			There are some basic technical concepts required but the rest is up to your imagination.</p>  
			<p>I also enjoy making jewelry out of glass seed beads.  I like to draw, paint, rubber stamp, knit, crochet.  
			Basically anything creative that has some defined approach, steps or method.  
			That is where my testing and analytical mindset connects with my hobbies. 
			I enjoy following clear and accurate steps when engaging in creative projects, so 
			I try to generate the same for the developers I support.</p>
